Installation
=================

The distant viewing toolkit (dvt) has been built and tested using Python 3.7.
We suggest installing the
`Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section/>`_.
After you have installed Python, the dvt package can be installed through PyPI
by running the following::

    pip install dvt

Additional Python requirements should be automatically installed automatically
through PyPI.
