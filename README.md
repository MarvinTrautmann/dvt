# Distant Viewing Toolkit (DVT) for the Cultural Analysis of Moving Images

**Note:** *This project is currently being developed and
will be iteratively improved and streamlined (we plan for
a stable release in summer 2019). Code is being made public along
the way to document the process and to encourage comments and
collaborations. Until the form of the toolkit settles down,
documentation and examples will be kept to minimum. Please
contact the maintainer (Taylor Arnold <taylor.arnold@acm.org>)
with any questions or concerns.*

The Distant TV Toolkit is designed to automatically extract
metadata features from a corpus of moving images. Our initial focus is on
features of interest to the study of television shows, but all of the
techniques should work on movies and other media formats.
